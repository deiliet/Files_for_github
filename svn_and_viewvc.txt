Here are the steps to setup ViewVC on Ubuntu Linux with Apache2 installed. These instructions assume that you have installed and setup svn already.

    1. First install svn, viewvc and apache2 packages.

    apt-get install subversion
    apt-get install viewvc
    apt-get install apache2

    2. These are the steps to install a test repository at /svn/repos/repo1

    	a) Create from defind user
    	sudo mkdir /svn
    	sudo chown www-data /svn
    	sudo -u www-data mkdir /svn/repos
    	sudo -u www-data svnadmin create /svn/repos/repo1

    	b) Create, Check and Commit SVN-repository. "svn checkout" is very necessary.
    	svnadmin create /home/deiliet/Config_Backups
		cd /home/deiliet/Config_Backups
		cd ..
		svn checkout file:///home/deiliet/Config_Backups

		mkdir /home/deiliet/Config_Backups/Device1
		nano /home/deiliet/Config_Backups/Device1/config1.txt

		svn add /home/deiliet/Config_Backups/Device1
		svn commit /home/deiliet/Config_Backups -m "22.12.2020"

    3. This will create an empty repository at /svn/repos/repo1. It should be owned by www-data as Apache runs as www-data and should be able to write here. I have also created file1.txt (2 revisions) and file2.txt in repo1 by checking out the source code.
    Change Apache conf file corresponding to svn and add these lines:

    Alias /viewvc-static /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/viewvc/templates-contrib/newvc/templates/docroot
    ScriptAlias /viewvc /usr/lib/viewvc/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi

    4. This will setup http://yoursvnserver.com/viewvc as url for browsing repository.
    Add this config entry to /etc/viewvc/viewvc.conf at appropriate place:

    svn_roots = repo1: /svn/repos/repo1

    You can also add multiple svn repositories here by separating them with “,”. e.g.

    svn_roots = repo1: /svn/repos/repo1, repo2: /svn/repos/repo2

    5. Check if cgi module is enabled/loaded

    $ apache2ctl -M | grep cgi
     cgi_module (shared)

    6. If it is not loaded, then run the following to enable it (Thanks Eric for the suggestion):

    $ sudo a2enmod cgi

    7. Restart apache

    $ sudo service apache2 restart

    Now browse  http://yoursvnserver.com/viewvc. Here is what you should see in ui:
